== MCA Thoughts

_NOTE: not sure what goes here but using it as a kind of 'scratchpad' for ideas._

=== Async and...

 * How far down the stack do we go?
   * AyncAPI (formats)
   * React (clients)
   * Serverless (services)
 * What's the target audience 
   * API Academy peeps
   * sofware architects
   * software engineers
   * API designers
   * ops/SRE/Chaos teams
   * C-Suite peeps
 * What's the expected output
   * whitepapar single or series
   * ORM report
   * Book
   * Youtube
   * Live talks

=== Working Style
If possible, I'd like to arrange some kind of regular touch points (weekly?) to help keep me oving along and guage our progress. I;m finding it helpful ("during a pandemic") to keep a predictable (if not productive) schedule. It keeps me motivated and moving along. I know timezones will be an issue as well as your real work, too. Let me know what you think.
